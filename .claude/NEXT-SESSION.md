# The one job

**The Customers screen on the phone — the sweep moves on.** The Sales Terminal is DONE on the
phone (his B + YES, `4ba6563`, CONFIRMED on his phone 2026-09-17 09:05). The sweep order he set on
2026-09-15: Sales Terminal → **Customers** → Agent Inventory → EOD Setoran → Stock Opname → Journey
Plan → Sampling → Agent Profile. Same method as the terminal, which took one morning:
build the lab mount, measure at 375 in the real shell, propose as frames, build what he picks.

Why it costs him money: a salesman registers and looks up shops from this screen on the phone;
the customer form's GPS box, the pin picker and the storefront photo were touched in September
(`2771374`, `5319aef` queue) but never measured at 375 inside the shell after the `p-2` cut.

## The mount (exact, read from the live files 2026-09-17 08:55)

`App.jsx:5040` `{activeTab === 'customers' && (` → `:5041` `<CustomerManagement` with NO wrapper
div at all — the component is a direct child of the shell's `biohazard-content`. So in
`tools/ponder-lab.jsx` `ShellLab()` add `q.has('customers')` BEFORE the `terminal` branch (the
`?shell&terminal` block at the `{q.has('terminal') ? (` line is the pattern; copy nothing but the
props). Component: `src/components/CustomerManager.jsx:203` `CustomerManagement` — read its props
list on that line; App passes `customers, db, appId, user, logAudit, triggerCapy, isAdmin, userRole,
employeeRegion, tierSettings, onNavigateToMap, onRequestCrop, croppedImage, onClearCroppedImage`.
Mount it as T5 (`FIELD_OPERATIVE`) with `LAB_CUSTOMERS` (four shops, already in the lab), `db={null}`
unless its listener needs the stub (then add a `FIXTURES['customers']`), `onRequestCrop` a no-op
that records to `window.__crop`. `?tab=` presses buttons by label — use it to open the register
form and a shop's detail (`CustomerDetailView` is exported from the same file).

## How to measure (the terminal's recipe, unchanged)

`preview_start ponder-lab` → `resize_window` 375×812 → `?shell&customers` → the probe reads
`innerWidth` in the SAME call as every rect (a hidden pane reports 0 and still returns numbers).
Both themes. List: every button/input/select under 44 tall, every text under 10 px, anything wider
than 375 (`scrollWidth`), the list row height, the form's reachable area with the keyboard open
(the phone's keyboard eats ~300 px — a Save button below the fold is a miss). Headless PNG for the
reply: `--window-size=518,900` with the `#root{width:375px}` pin in `?css=` (Looking at the App,
2026-09-17) so the frame IS the 375 layout; the pane is the number.

## How to propose

Frames with captions, TODAY beside each fix rendered through `?css=`, letters for the choices,
recommended one marked — the terminal boards (`st-wares.png`, `st-sheet.png`) are the shape he
answered in one sentence. No code before he answers. Then: classes on the elements (phone-first,
`lg:` reset so the desk keeps every number), element-scoped guards in `logicFixes.selfcheck.mjs`
trialled red then green, `npm run build; node src/config/integration.audit.mjs` (rebuild BEFORE the
audit if the audit file itself changed — it refuses a stale build), re-measure, frames of the
result, commit, ✅ TEST line.

**Traps.** (a) `CustomerManager.jsx:1337` is the storefront photo box — when PhotoField reaches it,
`scan` stays OFF (a shop is not a document) and the tier rule of that box is kept. (b) The form's
GPS box has `placeholder:italic` and `noValidate` on purpose (`2771374`) — do not "fix" them.
(c) `code()` in `logicFixes.selfcheck.mjs` strips a block-comment span that can swallow real code
further down a file (it ate the terminal's payment select and proof block) — when a regex that
matches the raw file fails on `msvSrc`-style stripped text, test the raw `read(...)` instead.
(d) The lab restores a localStorage draft on the terminal mount; the customers mount may keep its
own — a pre-filled form is that, not a bug. (e) Every frame at a MEASURED 375 inside the shell.

## Shipped 2026-09-17 — the Sales Terminal on the phone (`4ba6563`) and the vault press (`dfc2392`)

His pick on the boards: *"just change into B because it fit well and doesnt take a lot of space
and bigger button as well users need it, manifest also looks better since there is more space to
press and read yes"*. Picture 96 → 64 (p-1, 56 px target), − + 44, tabs/search 44, every sheet
control 44, labels 11 (unit labels 10, one row), the customer-bar button fills its bar. Guards 1574
(red 8 first), audit 722 (G7b re-pointed), desk probed at 1280 unchanged. Left alone: the admin
field-mode toggle (27 px) and six 8.5 px eyebrow labels in the customer brief.
Vault press: the security-profile read now starts when the gate is shown; "Checking…" + spinner
on the button while anything is left; guards 1579. Not seen by eye (behind Google sign-in).
✅ CONFIRMED by Aldi 09:05: *"t1 approve, t 2 approve, t3 i just tried to close the incognito and open it again after that i manual google login , master vault panel shows up enter password and it instantly let me in after press so i havent be able to see the processing animation tho"* — the wait is gone, so the spinner had nothing to show. Lab: `?shell&terminal`, `?grip`.

## Shipped 2026-09-16 20:29 — `c5c7ed3` the phone ribbon rests a quarter of the way down

His ask: *"25% from upper right as default location instead of just 50%"*. `BiohazardTheme.jsx:285`
default `Math.round(window.innerHeight * 0.25 - RIBBON_H / 2)`; a dragged spot (`kpm-ribbon-y`)
still wins. Guard 2 red → 1552/1552, audit 722, measured 137/812 in the pane. Packed build
rebuilt and serving on `https://192.168.1.107:4173`. Sample nota re-sent (`sample-nota.png`,
cream sheet on a dark ground) for the real-phone scan test.

## Shipped 2026-09-16 — the nota scanner finds the paper, squares it, and has a corner editor

`helpers.findPaper` (Otsu → largest bright blob → hull → best quad, null on sticker / L / full
frame) · `helpers.homography` · `helpers.warpQuad` (bilinear, ≤ 800 wide; one cycle of the corner
order = a 90° turn) · `helpers.loadNotaPhoto` (one decode at ≤ 1600, shared) ·
`scanNotaToBase64(file, { corners, turns })`: photo → findPaper → warpQuad → scanPixels →
deskewAngle → JPEG 0.5, old path when no sheet. `PhotoField`: SESUAIKAN → `CornerSheet` (dialog
language, 4×44 px pointer handles, ATAS marks the top edge, PUTAR 90°, BATAL, PAKAI → rescan →
`onFile(file, scan)`), asli / scan switch. Lab `?photo` is a tilted perspective sheet; `&edit`
opens the sheet. notaScan 22/22 (10 → 22), logicFixes 1547/1547 (17 red with the sources stashed),
audit 722/722. Drag, PUTAR, PAKAI exercised in the pane at a measured 375: output 378×311 →
321×407 after one turn. Timing on the PC: findPaper 8 ms, warpQuad 19 ms at 1600×1200.

✅ CONFIRMED by Aldi 2026-09-16 20:50: *"test 1 approve, nota looks align and good"* (the sample nota,
full screen on the PC, photographed at an angle). Phone URL `https://192.168.1.107:4173` (packed build;
the PC's address changes whenever the router hands out a new one — .143 → .131 → .107 in three days;
read it from the preview server's `Network:` line before writing it anywhere). Still owed: the
goods-photo preview test, ❓ the "bandung 1 / muntilan 1" tab.

## Shipped 2026-09-15 — Restock Vault on the phone, complete

`096ac05` tabs wrap · `289161a` bigger panel, hints gone, 44 px · `3bac5b7` notice box, button
row, nota scan A · `39dc277` scan levelled (±15°) · `5319aef` photo previews (`PhotoField`).
Tests 1–4 CONFIRMED by Aldi at 09:45. Lab: `?shell&places`, `?tab=`, `?nota-scan`, `?photo`.

## Shipped 2026-09-14 — `2af2dd9` — CONFIRMED by Aldi

The bell is on the phone screen. Owed from 2026-09-13: `2771374`, `d4bd41a`; from 2026-09-12:

### Promoted and parked behind the sweep

* **Lot tracking by production date — Master Vault + Regional Warehouse. MOCKED, not built.**
  His two answers: *"either FIVO or FEVO should be able to use as option"* (08:50) and *"make sure
  that the regional admin and the restock sender can choose which product with specific production
  date/batch to be sent or carried to the agent inventory"* (09:15). So: stock per batch at HQ and
  at each branch; every KIRIM line and every load-to-agent line carries a batch picker, the setting
  (FIFO oldest-first / FEFO nearest-expiry-first) pre-selects, the person can pick another; the
  surat jalan prints the date. Mock: `lot-mock.png` (scratchpad 2026-09-15). DECIDED 09:35: *"looks cool tbh u can add that lot
  tracking later"* — the mock is right, build AFTER the phone sweep. DECIDED 09:40: *"fivo or fevo doesnt do shit actually lol
  just add one of those or something and also this is should just work as recommendation and preselect
  the batch where actually the regional admin can manually choose from the selection tab"* — FIFO
  ONLY, no setting, no FEFO: the oldest production date is pre-selected as a recommendation and the
  sender picks any other batch from the list. Drop the Settings switch from the mock. Then 09:42: *"maybe just put FEVO or Manual selection just for
  ergonomics"* — so the picker itself carries a two-way control: OTOMATIS (tertua dulu — the app takes
  the oldest batch, one tap) / PILIH BATCH (the list). Plain words on screen, never the acronym
  (clear-terms rule); he may rename them. Facts: intake lines have `batchNo` (required,
  `RestockVaultView.jsx:493`), stock is one number (`:625` increment; engine `:371`). Touches:
  intake (productionDate required), Master Vault stock, Branch Warehouse stock, KIRIM, load to
  agent, surat jalan, Agent Inventory, the sale engine (money — two independent checks), Stock
  Opname, reports; migration = one "unknown batch" per product. Brainstorm §2 has the models.
* **PhotoField on the other photo boxes — one per screen AS THE SWEEP REACHES IT**, his
  "add preview on all photo attachment on this app": customer storefront `CustomerManager.jsx:1337`;
  sale proof `MerchantSalesView.jsx:2202`, NOO storefront `:2964` (⚠️ T4–T6 camera-only, no file
  input in the DOM — `284ea64`/`1857b97`, do not reintroduce a picker), `:1863`; product image
  `ResidentEvilInventory.jsx:297`; logos `SettingsView.jsx:412`, `:1238`; avatar/logo/border
  `AgentProfileView.jsx:895`, `:904`, `:1066`; face `App.jsx:4750`. Each keeps its own tier rule;
  `scan` only for documents (nota), never for goods, faces or logos.
* **Nota scanner, if his real-nota test shows a miss:** findPaper assumes the sheet is the BRIGHT
  class and the table darker. A white desk merges table and sheet → the quad fills the frame →
  null → old path (the editor still opens with the frame as the default corners). If that is what
  his phone shows, the next step is an edge-based finder (Sobel + the same hull/quad), not a
  threshold tweak. Corner precision is ± one sample step (≈ 5 px at 1600) — inside the sheet, so
  the warp loses a hair of margin, never a band of table.
* **Parked, his words:** *"i was thinking on redesign the method the regional admin fill the
  agent inventory but we'll decide first if this really needed or not in the app"* — not a job
  until he says so.
* **The fleet form's tier picker paints T3 for a value that is not an option.**
  `src/FleetCanvasManager.jsx:149-153` `defaultAgentState.userRole: 'AGENT'`; `:843` the tier
  `<select>` is `value={newAgent.userRole || 'AGENT'}`; `src/config/permissions.js:2-9` has no
  `'AGENT'` id, so the browser paints the first option (`AREA_ADMIN`, "T3: HQ SALES MANAGER")
  while the state keeps `'AGENT'`, which `:72` normalises to T5 at read time. Form shows T3, saves
  a T5. ❓ for Aldi: which tier should a new Sales Motorist get by default — T5 (today, hidden) or
  T6 (what the label says)? Diff `ROLE_PERMISSIONS[FIELD_OPERATIVE]` vs `[ROOKIE]` before
  describing the change. Do NOT delete `:72` — old records rely on it. Edit paths `:374`, `:389`.

### Still ship-blocking, and both are his call

* **Rank Config cross-tenant gap.** `artifacts/cello-inventory-manager/settings/{achievements,
  rpg_ranks}` is ONE document shared by every company. Rules coverage was fixed; the shared path was
  not. Safe for one customer, not two — between tobacco competitors that is a confidentiality breach,
  not a bug. **Pasal 10 ayat (3) of the contract draft promises per-customer separation, so this is a
  clause he cannot honestly sign twice until it is fixed.**
* **PBKDF2.** The SHA-256 master-password hash is unsalted and single-round. `crypto.subtle` already
  offers PBKDF2; a per-company salt and about 100k iterations turns a claim that invites inspection
  into one that survives it. Offered, never answered.

### Business track — CLOSED and PARKED, do not reopen

All prices in one place: `A-Brain/Wiki/Entities/KPM Price Sheet.md`. Rp 5 juta/bulan recommended at
25-30 users, **Aldi leans Rp 10 juta** as intent, floor Rp 2 juta, perpetual Rp 250 juta, copyright
**not for sale**, final PPh Rp 0. Legal research: `Brainstorm/2026-09-10_riset-hukum-menjual-kpm.md`.

<https://claude.ai/code/artifact/4fed138f-1639-4317-b41f-41bbf6613305>

### Rebuild sales totals — DONE, stop asking

Aldi pressed it 2026-09-09 and 2026-09-10. **Do not put this on a list again.**

### Phone — the lab instruments that exist now

* `?shell` — the app shell (top bar, ribbon). `?places` — Restock Vault. `?gudang` — branch
  warehouse. `?nota`, `?label`, `?scan`, `?perf`, `?plan`, `?minkirim`, `?toast`, `?nota-scan`,
  `?photo` (`&busy`, `&edit`).
* `?css=<rules>` on any mount — render a proposed change before writing it.
* `preview_start` ponder-lab → `resize_window` 375×812 → probe with `innerWidth` in the same call.
  Headless Chrome crops under ~518; an iframe wrapper does NOT work headless (the frames never
  finish loading) — shoot at 518 for the file, measure at 375 in the pane.

### Wording — cheap, each one read by a customer

The EOD verify confirm claiming "clears their inventory" on a stamps-only card, the EOD `MATCHES`
column showing a dash when the numbers are equal, the audit receipt printing `BAYAR : CASH` on an
audit that collected Rp 0.

### Closed — do not reopen

**Money.** A cash refund does not reduce omzet. A completed sale is a closed contract; a retur is the
salesman's private arrangement. Buyback is off for everyone including the owner; Exchange stays.
`A-Brain/Wiki/Concepts/A sale is a closed contract — no cash goes back.md`. Not a bug.

**The sale-proof camera.** `284ea64` plus `1857b97`. T4 to T6 open a real `getUserMedia` view and
have no file input in the DOM in ANY build; T1 to T3 keep the picker. **Do not reintroduce a
build-mode escape hatch.** To let a tier attach a file, turn `photo_pick_from_gallery` ON in the
matrix, test, turn it off. Untouched on purpose: the GPS-bypass proof photo at
`MerchantSalesView.jsx:1863` and the NOO storefront photo at `:2964`.

**What "low" means.** Settled 2026-08-25, adopted everywhere 2026-09-12. Own MIN. ALERT (Bks) if
set, else the company default (qty + unit, default 3 Bal) converted per product. Blank means "use
the company default". `A-Brain/Wiki/Entities/What Counts As Low.md`.

### Appearance — deferred on purpose, last

About 180 blue and green Tailwind classes in app UI: `MapMissionControl.jsx` 58,
`FleetCanvasManager.jsx` 50, `JourneyView.jsx` 33, `ConsignmentFinanceView.jsx` 33. Receipt and
surat-jalan blues are legal.

### Still owed from earlier sessions

Round 7 Section D of `MANUAL_TEST_CHECKLIST.md` has never been run. C4 needs a second BANDUNG account.
`cdaabc7`, `967e447`, `83f5041` are unverified by eye. Bug 3, the geofence bypass routing, is still
unanswered — the GPS-bypass approvals were among the nine paths `da71cbd` re-routed, so re-check
before treating it as open.
